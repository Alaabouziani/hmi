\section{Conclusion}

The iterative combination of interface design, explicit validation feedback, and deterministic modeling ensures that end users understand both the registration and authentication processes. Linking the GUI states to automata clarifies navigation continuity, while the NetBeans implementation demonstrates feasibility. Future work may include usability testing sessions and internationalisation of messages so the application can serve a broader audience with the same interaction quality.
