\section{Implementation Notes}

The NetBeans Swing GUI Builder was used to instantiate the designed interfaces. Key steps:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Create a new Java Swing form named \texttt{LoginRegisterTabbed} and configure a tabbed pane containing the registration and authentication panels.
  \item Drag-and-drop Swing components (labels, text fields, password fields, buttons) while aligning them using NetBeans' layout guides to maintain consistent spacing.
  \item Attach event handlers to the \textit{Validate}, \textit{Cancel}, and recovery buttons. Validation logic follows the rules summarised in Section~\ref{sec:context}.\\The full implementation is available at \path{/home/alaa/hmi/LoginRegisterTabbed.java}.
  \item Display contextual errors through coloured labels or dialog boxes. On successful validation, open the confirmation dialog (registration) or navigate to the protected view (authentication).
  \item Capture the screenshots listed earlier by running the application, populating the form with test data, and using the operating system's screenshot utility. Save the resulting images into \texttt{docs/images/}.
\end{enumerate}

Each screen capture should correspond to the state identifiers used in the automata to preserve traceability between design artefacts and the implementation.
